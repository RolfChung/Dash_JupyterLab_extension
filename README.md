<p>
The purpose of this project is to run a Hello World Dash app within Jupyter Lab.<br>
This is made possible through the JupyterDash extension for Jupyter Lab by Plotly.<br>
Juypter Notebooks or any other notebooks are not the prefered environment for running Dash apps.<br>
Dash Apps are pushed to servers in batch processes, instead of following the sequential processes of notebooks.<br>
The goal here is therefore not to create the perfect Dash app, but make the JupyterDash extension work.<br>
